"""Prompt templates for the deep research system.

This module contains all prompt templates used across the research workflow components,
including user clarification, research brief generation, and report synthesis.
"""

clarify_with_user_instructions="""
These are the messages that have been exchanged so far from the user asking for the report:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

Assess whether you need to ask a clarifying question, or if the user has already provided enough information for you to start research.
IMPORTANT: If you can see in the messages history that you have already asked a clarifying question, you almost always do not need to ask another one. Only ask another question if ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

If there are acronyms, abbreviations, or unknown terms, ask the user to clarify.
If you need to ask a question, follow these guidelines:
- Be concise while gathering all necessary information
- Make sure to gather all the information needed to carry out the research task in a concise, well-structured manner.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists if appropriate for clarity. Make sure that this uses markdown formatting and will be rendered correctly if the string output is passed to a markdown renderer.
- Don't ask for unnecessary information, or information that the user has already provided. If you can see that the user has already provided the information, do not ask for it again.

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarification": boolean,
"question": "<question to ask the user to clarify the report scope>",
"verification": "<verification message that we will start research>"

If you need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": true,
"question": "<your clarifying question>",
"verification": ""

If you do not need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": false,
"question": "",
"verification": "<acknowledgement message that you will now start research based on the provided information>"

For the verification message when no clarification is needed:
- Acknowledge that you have sufficient information to proceed
- Briefly summarize the key aspects of what you understand from their request
- Confirm that you will now begin the research process
- Keep the message concise and professional

transform_messages_into_research_topic_prompt = """You will be given a set of messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user. 
Your job is to translate these messages into a more detailed and concrete research question that will be used to guide the research.

The messages that have been exchanged so far between yourself and the user are:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

You will return a single research question that will be used to guide the research.

Guidelines:
1. Maximize Specificity and Detail
- Include all known user preferences and explicitly list key attributes or dimensions to consider.
- It is important that all details from the user are included in the instructions.

2. Handle Unstated Dimensions Carefully
- When research quality requires considering additional dimensions that the user hasn't specified, acknowledge them as open considerations rather than assumed preferences.
- Example: Instead of assuming "budget-friendly options," say "consider all price ranges unless cost constraints are specified."
- Only mention dimensions that are genuinely necessary for comprehensive research in that domain.

3. Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions
- Never invent specific user preferences, constraints, or requirements that weren't stated.
- If the user hasn't provided a particular detail, explicitly note this lack of specification.
- Guide the researcher to treat unspecified aspects as flexible rather than making assumptions.

4. Distinguish Between Research Scope and User Preferences
- Research scope: What topics/dimensions should be investigated (can be broader than user's explicit mentions)
- User preferences: Specific constraints, requirements, or preferences (must only include what user stated)
- Example: "Research coffee quality factors (including bean sourcing, roasting methods, brewing techniques) for San Francisco coffee shops, with primary focus on taste as specified by the user."

5. Use the First Person
- Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.

6. Sources
- If specific sources should be prioritized, specify them in the research question.
- For product and travel research, prefer linking directly to official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregator sites or SEO-heavy blogs.
- For academic or scientific queries, prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.
- For people, try linking directly to their LinkedIn profile, or their personal website if they have one.
- If the query is in a specific language, prioritize sources published in that language.

summarize_webpage_prompt = """You are tasked with summarizing the raw content of a webpage retrieved from a web search. Your goal is to create a summary that preserves the most important information from the original web page. This summary will be used by a downstream research agent, so it's crucial to maintain the key details without losing essential information.

Here is the raw content of the webpage:

<webpage_content>
{webpage_content}
</webpage_content>

Please follow these guidelines to create your summary:

1. Identify and preserve the main topic or purpose of the webpage.
2. Retain key facts, statistics, and data points that are central to the content's message.
3. Keep important quotes from credible sources or experts.
4. Maintain the chronological order of events if the content is time-sensitive or historical.
5. Preserve any lists or step-by-step instructions if present.
6. Include relevant dates, names, and locations that are crucial to understanding the content.
7. Summarize lengthy explanations while keeping the core message intact.

When handling different types of content:

- For news articles: Focus on the who, what, when, where, why, and how.
- For scientific content: Preserve methodology, results, and conclusions.
- For opinion pieces: Maintain the main arguments and supporting points.
- For product pages: Keep key features, specifications, and unique selling points.

Your summary should be significantly shorter than the original content but comprehensive enough to stand alone as a source of information. Aim for about 25-30 percent of the original length, unless the content is already concise.

Present your summary in the following format:

```
{{
   "summary": "Your summary here, structured with appropriate paragraphs or bullet points as needed",
   "key_excerpts": "First important quote or excerpt, Second important quote or excerpt, Third important quote or excerpt, ...Add more excerpts as needed, up to a maximum of 5"

Example 1 (for a news article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "On July 15, 2023, NASA successfully launched the Artemis II mission from Kennedy Space Center. This marks the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. The four-person crew, led by Commander Jane Smith, will orbit the Moon for 10 days before returning to Earth. This mission is a crucial step in NASA's plans to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon by 2030.",
   "key_excerpts": "Artemis II represents a new era in space exploration, said NASA Administrator John Doe. The mission will test critical systems for future long-duration stays on the Moon, explained Lead Engineer Sarah Johnson. We're not just going back to the Moon, we're going forward to the Moon, Commander Jane Smith stated during the pre-launch press conference."
}}
```

Example 2 (for a scientific article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals that global sea levels are rising faster than previously thought. Researchers analyzed satellite data from 1993 to 2022 and found that the rate of sea-level rise has accelerated by 0.08 mm/year² over the past three decades. This acceleration is primarily attributed to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The study projects that if current trends continue, global sea levels could rise by up to 2 meters by 2100, posing significant risks to coastal communities worldwide.",
   "key_excerpts": "Our findings indicate a clear acceleration in sea-level rise, which has significant implications for coastal planning and adaptation strategies, lead author Dr. Emily Brown stated. The rate of ice sheet melt in Greenland and Antarctica has tripled since the 1990s, the study reports.

REMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!
Make sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.

For each section of the report, do the following:
- Use simple, clear language
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report
- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. 
- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.
- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.
- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.

REMEMBER:
The brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.
Make sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.

Format the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.

<Citation Rules>
- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text
- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers
- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose
- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.
- Example format:
  [1] Source Title: URL
  [2] Source Title: URL
- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.

BRIEF_CRITERIA_PROMPT = """
<role>
You are an expert research brief evaluator specializing in assessing whether generated research briefs accurately capture user-specified criteria without loss of important details.
</role>

<task>
Determine if the research brief adequately captures the specific success criterion provided. Return a binary assessment with detailed reasoning.
</task>

<evaluation_context>
Research briefs are critical for guiding downstream research agents. Missing or inadequately captured criteria can lead to incomplete research that fails to address user needs. Accurate evaluation ensures research quality and user satisfaction.
</evaluation_context>

<criterion_to_evaluate>
{criterion}
</criterion_to_evaluate>

<research_brief>
{research_brief}
</research_brief>

<evaluation_guidelines>
CAPTURED (criterion is adequately represented) if:
- The research brief explicitly mentions or directly addresses the criterion
- The brief contains equivalent language or concepts that clearly cover the criterion
- The criterion's intent is preserved even if worded differently
- All key aspects of the criterion are represented in the brief

NOT CAPTURED (criterion is missing or inadequately addressed) if:
- The criterion is completely absent from the research brief
- The brief only partially addresses the criterion, missing important aspects
- The criterion is implied but not clearly stated or actionable for researchers
- The brief contradicts or conflicts with the criterion

<evaluation_examples>
Example 1 - CAPTURED:
Criterion: "Current age is 25"
Brief: "...investment advice for a 25-year-old investor..."
Judgment: CAPTURED - age is explicitly mentioned

Example 2 - NOT CAPTURED:
Criterion: "Monthly rent below 7k"
Brief: "...find apartments in Manhattan with good amenities..."
Judgment: NOT CAPTURED - budget constraint is completely missing

Example 3 - CAPTURED:
Criterion: "High risk tolerance"
Brief: "...willing to accept significant market volatility for higher returns..."
Judgment: CAPTURED - equivalent concept expressed differently

Example 4 - NOT CAPTURED:
Criterion: "Doorman building required"
Brief: "...find apartments with modern amenities..."
Judgment: NOT CAPTURED - specific doorman requirement not mentioned
</evaluation_examples>
</evaluation_guidelines>

<output_instructions>
1. Carefully examine the research brief for evidence of the specific criterion
2. Look for both explicit mentions and equivalent concepts
3. Provide specific quotes or references from the brief as evidence
4. Be systematic - when in doubt about partial coverage, lean toward NOT CAPTURED for quality assurance
5. Focus on whether a researcher could act on this criterion based on the brief alone
</output_instructions>"""

BRIEF_HALLUCINATION_PROMPT = """
## Brief Hallucination Evaluator

<role>
You are a meticulous research brief auditor specializing in identifying unwarranted assumptions that could mislead research efforts.
</role>

<task>  
Determine if the research brief makes assumptions beyond what the user explicitly provided. Return a binary pass/fail judgment.
</task>

<evaluation_context>
Research briefs should only include requirements, preferences, and constraints that users explicitly stated or clearly implied. Adding assumptions can lead to research that misses the user's actual needs.
</evaluation_context>

<research_brief>
{research_brief}
</research_brief>

<success_criteria>
{success_criteria}
</success_criteria>

<evaluation_guidelines>
PASS (no unwarranted assumptions) if:
- Brief only includes explicitly stated user requirements
- Any inferences are clearly marked as such or logically necessary
- Source suggestions are general recommendations, not specific assumptions
- Brief stays within the scope of what the user actually requested

FAIL (contains unwarranted assumptions) if:
- Brief adds specific preferences user never mentioned
- Brief assumes demographic, geographic, or contextual details not provided
- Brief narrows scope beyond user's stated constraints
- Brief introduces requirements user didn't specify

<evaluation_examples>
Example 1 - PASS:
User criteria: ["Looking for coffee shops", "In San Francisco"] 
Brief: "...research coffee shops in San Francisco area..."
Judgment: PASS - stays within stated scope

Example 2 - FAIL:
User criteria: ["Looking for coffee shops", "In San Francisco"]
Brief: "...research trendy coffee shops for young professionals in San Francisco..."
Judgment: FAIL - assumes "trendy" and "young professionals" demographics

Example 3 - PASS:
User criteria: ["Budget under $3000", "2 bedroom apartment"]
Brief: "...find 2-bedroom apartments within $3000 budget, consulting rental sites and local listings..."
Judgment: PASS - source suggestions are appropriate, no preference assumptions

Example 4 - FAIL:
User criteria: ["Budget under $3000", "2 bedroom apartment"] 
Brief: "...find modern 2-bedroom apartments under $3000 in safe neighborhoods with good schools..."
Judgment: FAIL - assumes "modern", "safe", and "good schools" preferences
</evaluation_examples>
</evaluation_guidelines>

<output_instructions>
Carefully scan the brief for any details not explicitly provided by the user. Be strict - when in doubt about whether something was user-specified, lean toward FAIL.
